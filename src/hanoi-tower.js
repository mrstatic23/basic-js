// Tower of Hanoi
// Tower of Hanoi is famous mathematical puzzle of the 18th century. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.
// The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
// 
// Only one disk can be moved at a time.
// Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
// No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
// Your task is much easier than coming up with an algorithm that solves this puzzle :)
// 
// Implement the function calculateHanoi that accepts diskNumber and turnsSpeed parameters. diskNumber is a number of disks and turnsSpeed is the speed of moving discs (in turns per hour). Both parameters are numbers.
// 
// calculateHanoi function returns an object with 2 properties:
// 
// turns (minimum number of turns to solve the puzzle)
// seconds (minimum number of seconds to solve the puzzle at a given turnsSpeed, seconds must be an integer, obtained from rounded down (floor) calculation result)
// You don't need to validate parameters.
// 
// For example:
// calculateHanoi(9, 4308) => { turns: 511, seconds: 427 }
// 
// Write your code in src/hanoi-tower.js.





module.exports = function calculateHanoi(disksNumber, turnsSpeed) {

  result.turns = Math.pow(2, disksNumber) - 1;
  result.seconds = Math.floor(result.turns / (turnsSpeed / 3600))
